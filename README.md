## Introduction

GoSiMac downloads Bing daily wallpapers and random images from Unsplash, etc.
for you to have beautiful wallpaper on your desktop whenever you want.

Personally, I wrote this to have fun and help one of my friends who is not among us right now. :disappointed:

This module is highly customizable and new sources can easily add just by implementing source interface.

## Docker

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/.:/root/Pictures/GoSiMac 1995parham/gosimac ...
```
